## Overview

The `STUCTURE.popgen` provides functions for using supplied [STRUCTURE](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html) q-matrix assignment probabilities to account for uncertainty while calculating population genetics metrics among population clusters. Functions are also provided for working more seamlessly through well-established `R` packages (`adegenet`, `PopGenReport`, and `hierfstat`) to calculate individual-based and population-based population genetics metrics.

## Installation

You can install `STUCTURE.popgen` from `GitHub` with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicholasjclark/STRUCTURE.popgen")
```
